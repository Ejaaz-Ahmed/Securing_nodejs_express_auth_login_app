# Secure Node.js Express Login & Registration with JWT â€“ Enhanced Version by Ejaz Ahmed

This is an enhanced, secure, and modernized version of the original [Bezkoder's Node.js Express JWT Authentication Example](https://www.bezkoder.com/node-js-express-login-example/). It includes improvements for security, code quality, and ES module support.

---

## Whatâ€™s Improved in This Fork

-  **Converted all code to ES Modules (import/export)**
-  **Added strong email & password validation using [`validator`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator)**
-  **Secured routes with `helmet`, `cookie-session`, and CORS headers**
-  **Enforced Foreign Key constraints in MySQL with Sequelize**
-  **Sanitized input to prevent weak credentials**
-  **Improved Role-based Access Control (User / Admin / Moderator)**
-  **Resolved all Sequelize sync issues (e.g., `createdAt`/`updatedAt` not null)**
-  **Removed vulnerabilities present in original version**
-  **Rewritten with clean, modular ES syntax**

## Reference to Original Repo

This project is based on:

ğŸ”— [Bezkoder Node.js JWT Auth Example](https://www.bezkoder.com/node-js-express-login-example/)

> This fork enhances it with security hardening, ES modules, and project structure improvements.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add rate limiting / brute-force protection
- Add CSRF token in cookies
- Add frontend (React/Vue/Angular) clients
- Unit testing with Jest

---

## Updates â€“ Advanced Security & Final Reporting

I enhanced the **Node.js Express Authentication App** by performing advanced security hardening, logging setup, and penetration testing.  

### ğŸ”¹ Security Enhancements
- **Brute Force Protection** â€“ Implemented rate limiting to block excessive failed login attempts.
- **Winston Logging** â€“ Added `winston` logger to record security-related events in both console and `security.log`.
- **Basic Penetration Testing** â€“ Used Nmap to scan service details and checked for unnecessary exposure.
- **Role Escalation Protection** â€“ Verified that non-admin tokens cannot access admin routes.
- **Strong Validation** â€“ Continued enforcing strong password & email validation using `validator`.
- **Helmet.js Middleware** â€“ Applied HTTP security headers to mitigate common vulnerabilities.
- **HTTPS Recommendation** â€“ App is ready to run behind HTTPS for secure data transmission.

### ğŸ”¹ Documentation
- Updated **Security Checklist** confirming all measures applied.
- Added **Final Detailed Documentation** for Week 3 work.

### ğŸ”¹ Tools Used
- **Postman** â€“ API testing and role escalation checks.
- **Nmap** â€“ Port scanning & service fingerprinting.
- **Winston** â€“ Security and application logging.

---

**Outcome:**  
The application is now more secure, logs critical events, and prevents unauthorized role access & brute-force attacks. All checklist items are marked as passed.
